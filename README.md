##  Bot that collects the more popular games from [Itch.io](https://itch.io/) and publish them in Twitter and Tumblr! <3

### Details

- **itchioscrapper.py** scraps data from **[Itch.io](https://itch.io/)**
- **qbotqueuer.py** queues tweets on **Twitter** using **[Qbot](https://github.com/alvivar/qbot)**
- **tumblrqueuer.py** queues posts on **Tumblr**, but this script is also the program main, calling both of them ^ on his execution
- Check it out! **[bestgamesintheplanet.tumblr](https://bestgamesintheplanet.tumblr.com/)** and **[@bestgamesbot](https://twitter.com/bestgamesbot)**

### Why are doing this? Is this spam? Are you being careful with the scrap?

I love **[Itch.io](https://itch.io/)** and his community, I just want an
eternal collection of his popular games to get inspired when I feel like it.

As time passes by, some cool games get buried. I guess I want to meet them all.
This could also be a new channel to support the creators work, I'll try my
best.
